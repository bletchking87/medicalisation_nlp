The words that caught the mood of the decade are all there in a book published yesterday - clone, concentration camp, gene, fetishism, paranoid, deja vu, hangover, depression. Except that the decade was not the 1990s but the 1900s. The Guinness book of the 20th century cites lists of buzz-words for each decade to show that there are few new things under the sun. Clone was coined in 1903 by the journal Science to mean a "plant propagated by the use of any form of vegetative parts". It was borrowed for genetics in 1970 by an author who said people "most likely to replicate themselves will be narcissists - and the clones they produce will also be narcissists". Fetishism, "often for shoes, rubber or underclothes", was defined by a psychologist in the 1900s. As is better known, the first protest over a concentration camp came in the House of Commons in 1901 during the Boer war. The mouse was christened in 1965 by English and Engelhardt in their book Computer-Aided Display as "a device called a mouse which we have developed for evaluation as a means of selectively displaying text entities". The Guinness wordlist also includes: 1900s: curriculum vitae, hot dog, electronic; 1910s: jinx, floozy, birth control, loony bin; 1920s: deadline, gaga, cold turkey, superstar, media; 1930s: Muzak, backlog, ecosystem, satellite; 1940s: loo, gremlin, antibiotic, teenager, soap opera, fax; 1950s: Fall-out, hype, discotheque, DIY; 1960s: drop-out, serial killer, rubber johnny; 1970s: child abuse, veggie-burger, soundbite, trainer; 1980s: toyboy, chatline, wannabe, car boot sale, Yardie; 1990s: ethnic cleansing, stalk, road rage, quality time, new lad, cyberstress.
