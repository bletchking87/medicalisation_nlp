Government advisers are to commission research to try to establish if some farmers suffer long-term illness from routine use of sheep dip. They accept that concentrated organophosphates (OPs) are a hazard, but their study published yesterday of the effects at diluted doses was inconclusive. They suggested the "balance of evidence" was that exposure in this form did not cause nerve damage, but said more research was needed to find whether some people, for genetic or other reasons, were prone to illness. The committee on toxicity admitted that most of the findingsconcentrated on farmers fit enough to continue working, leaving a gap regarding those rendered unfit possibly by OPs. Hundreds of farmers have contacted lawyers to press for compensation for dizziness, impotence and muscle problems, or severe depression. However, the committee noted that researchers who reported apparent dangers found that farmers commonly did not wear approved protective clothing.
