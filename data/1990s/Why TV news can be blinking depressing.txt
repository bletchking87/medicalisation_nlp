Floods, fires, earthquakes - there is every reason to feel anxious while watching the TV news. But now there is evidence that the disquiet may be due to empathy with the nervous newscaster. According to researchers in Tokyo, newscasters on camera would be expected to blink less often than most of us, because they are reading from an autocue. To their surprise, they found they were blinking a whole lot more. The scientists' thesis is that newsreaders blink more often because of performance nerves, and that their anxieties are transmitted through the screen to viewers. Kazuo Tsubota and colleagues in Tokyo used videotape to examine blinking patterns of 64 volunteers (the control group) and 24 Japanese newscasters. An analysis, done by video-recording the news broadcast and counting the blinks in at least three tapes running for 10 seconds each, showed that the newscasters blinked once every second, while the controls blinked once every four seconds. The scientists, writing in the Lancet, say: "Since newscasters are presumably under pressure not to make errors and the environment in the TV studios is bright and dry, these factors may also affect their blinking patterns."
