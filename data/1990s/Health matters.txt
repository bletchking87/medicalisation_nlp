Alan Milburn (News, last week) on 'beating heart disease' misses the mark. All major reports on health inequalities since 1980 have emphasised how health inequality is a result of social inequality. On this Milburn says nothing. The only 'radical and far-reaching programmes' that will make a difference is one that addresses social inequality. Milburn cannot do this. He offers jam tomorrow on access to cardiac services and emphasises the dangers of smoking. These are the issues that fit in with the needs of the Labour Government's middle-class supporters. The poor haven't had a health service worth speaking of for years. It is the middle classes that are now getting worried about the demise of the health service and Labour doesn't want to upset them. Calls to attack smoking also fits in with a middle-class concern about responsible behaviour, and it is an approach which, by blaming the victim, lets the Government off the hook.
