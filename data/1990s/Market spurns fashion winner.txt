The depression over the high street fashion business took its toll on the New Look chain yesterday despite respectable profit and sales figures. New Look, which now operates from 491 stores and specialises in sharply-priced street fashion, unveiled profits up 8.8% at £27.3m for the six months to the end of September on sales up 16%. The dividend was hoisted 11% to 2p. New Look has bought former Mothercare sites before and Storehouse, which owns the mother and baby chain, confirmed last week that it is to concentrate on large out of town Mothercare World stores. Chief executive Jim Hodgkinson admitted conditions were difficult, but said the group's results were "extremely solid, placing us among the winners". But the shares tumbled 16p to 135.5p, and are now 44% down on their July peak of 242p, trading below their 170p float price of June 1998. "It's not due to New Look's performance, it's the way the market feels about the clothing business at the moment," said Isabelle Payet, an analyst with Sutherlands, who has a "buy" rating on the stock. New Look has some 3% of the womenswear market and sells at prices 15% to 20% below those of it main rivals. Until now the bargain end of the retail sector has proved fairly immune to the gloom, but the threat of further price cutting from M&amp;S and Bhs is now hitting confidence at the value end of the market too. Yesterday shares in discount warehouse group Matalan lost 85p to 1330p. • Marks and Spencer's figures may be slipping, but the crowds which gathered outside the company's new flagship store in Manchester yesterday suggested the nation's appetite for underwear has not abated. Shoppers queued from 8am to get a look inside the world's largest M&amp;S, which opened to the public 3 years after an IRA bomb destroyed the original and much of the area around it in the city centre. M&amp;S has used the four-storey store to launch a range of services to arrest declining sales.
