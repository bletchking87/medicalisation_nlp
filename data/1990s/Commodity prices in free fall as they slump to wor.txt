Twenty-five years ago, the industrial world stood on the brink of a lava-flow of commodity-price inflation. Panic buyers descended on British supermarkets, spurred by rumours of sugar and bread shortages. The price of petrol went through the roof as the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, pleaded with developing countries not to imitate the oil-cartel Opec and throttle supplies of essential commodities. Today, commodity producers have never had it so bad - at least, not since the 1930s. A World Bank report last month was blunt: 'The prices for many primary commodities have declined more than 50 per cent from their recent highs'. And those 'highs', in the mid-1990s, were themselves a big drop on the record prices seen in the 1970s and early 1980s. Gold prices, for example, hit nearly $1,000 an ounce in January 1980. Yesterday they stood at just $288. Black gold has fared no better. Supertankers, loaded with crude, roam the high seas, looking for somewhere to offload their wares. Brent crude averaged $19 a barrel in 1997 (against about $32 a barrel in 1982). The Shell group decided to be pessimistic and plan for a $14 price in 1998. The price averaged $13, with a 40 per cent dive in the last quarter of the year. Yesterday Shell announced a profits crash and pledged to do whatever it takes to survive indefinitely at the current price of about $10 a barrel -or even lower. Low growth, low inflation and economic crises in Asia, Russia and now Brazil all add up to produce eerie parallels with the run-up to the Great Depression of the inter-war years. Compared to mid-1990s levels, all primary products have crashed, according to the World Bank. Coffee is down 54 per cent, cotton 51 per cent, wheat 41 per cent, sugar 51 per cent, crude oil 56 per cent, rubber 65 per cent, aluminium 39 per cent, copper 52 per cent, nickel 60 per cent and lead 41 per cent. For developing countries, the crash is a disaster. In sub-Saharan Africa, commodities account for three-quarters of export earnings. Nor is there any improvement forecast. The Bank of England is looking for flat commodity prices for 1999, while the World Bank predicts lower real prices for most commodities in 2010 than in 1997. Property agent FPD Savills is equally gloomy regarding the most basic of all commodities - the soil. Its index of British farmland prices stands 13 per cent below its 1997 level.
