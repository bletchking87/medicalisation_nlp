Jonathan Gloag, 28, the son of the multi-millionaire Stagecoach bus mogul, Ann Gloag, has been found dead, hanging in a Perthshire wood. He had a long history of depression. Mr Gloag stood to inherit much of the £2.5bn group founded by his mother and his uncle, Brian Souter. He and his wife, Sarah, had only recently celebrated the birth of their third child, Matthew. Mrs Gloag always maintained in her rare interviews that her family was more important to her than the £850m personal fortune which has made her the fourth richest woman in Britain. As the family gathered at Mrs Gloag's home, Balcraig House, yesterday a spokesman said they were trying to come terms with the death. "Jonathan's wife and his children are being comforted by the family." Mrs Gloag and her brother launched their phenomenally successful company 30 years ago with £25,000 of their father's redundancy money. It has risen to become one of the world's largest bus companies. Mr Gloag, whose body was found late on Friday, trained as a chef but worked in estate management. He was Mrs Gloag's son from her first marriage to Robin Gloag. The couple also had a daughter, Pamela. Mrs Gloag, who four years ago adopted a Kenyan orphan whom she met while expanding her bus empire in Africa, has said: "To me, family life is everything. If I thought money would spoil it I would throw it all away."
