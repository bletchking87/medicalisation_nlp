Leisure group Bass yesterday punched its way through some of the depression overhanging the big British brewers when it unveiled a 4.8% rise in profits to £682m for the year to September. The company said that even though brewing was out of fashion and the stock market regarded investment in pubs with growing scepticism, there was no intention of separating these businesses by spinning off the beer company. Sir Ian Prosser, the chief executive, said all the group's businesses were experiencing strong growth and none was on the for sale list. Operating profits from hotels and resorts rose 23.5%, leisure retail which includes pubs, saw its profits grow nearly 11%, while profits from brewing climbed 7.8%. Earnings at Britvic soft drinks rose 15.8%. Bass has earmarked £240m to be spent upgrading the 550 pubs it has just acquired from Punch Taverns, following that company's purchase of Allied Domecq's 3,500-strong estate. About £120m of this will be spent in the current financial year and Bass says it is confident it will continue to achieve a return of 20% on these conversions. A further £180m has been set aside for spending on the group's other retail businesses and that is in addition to £400m which it will plough into expanding its Inter-Continental hotels chain, which delivered an underlying profits growth of 23%. Bass shares gained 9.5p to 704p in trading yesterday.
