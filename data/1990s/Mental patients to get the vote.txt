Patients in mental hospitals and the homeless are to gain the right to vote in a shake-up of the electoral system to be announced in the Queen's Speech next month. The final report of a government working party on electoral procedures, which will form the basis of new legislation, recommends that the ban on voting for mental patients - long established under Common law - should be overturned. Other recommendations certain to be taken up in legislation include pilot projects for alternative voting arrangements, including weekend polls and voting in supermarkets. There will also be changes to registration, including introduction of a rolling electoral register, with the aim of widening democratic participation. Under the working party's proposals, restrictions on using psychiatric hospitals as residences for voting registration would be removed, allowing detained and voluntary patients to vote. "We believe it right that the democratic right to register and vote should not be withheld unless there are clear and justifiable grounds for so doing," said the report, published yesterday. The new right would not extend to convicted criminals in mental institutions. The working party, which included representatives of all main political parties, as well as electoral administrators and representatives of local government, set out measures to ensure that rough sleepers and people with no fixed address were able to vote. Instead of permanent addresses, registration officers should be able to accept a "declaration of locality", where would-be voters could be proved to have a connection with an area, or a temporary address such as a hostel or day centre, the report said. Ministers are keen to see reforms to the electoral system amid signs that young people in particular are increasingly passing up their right to vote. The report also recommended that electors should have the option of keeping details provided for registration purposes out of the commerically available register.
