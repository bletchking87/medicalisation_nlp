A 19-year-old man killed two people and wounded three others before turning his gun on himself in a bloody weekend shooting spree in Miami. A bomb was found in a car abandoned by Jonathan Erik Carter before he shot himself. Police said the four attacks that occurred over a distance of about 20 miles - ranging from central Miami to the south-western suburb of Kendall - may have been caused by depression, unrequited love and a friend's betrayal. "We can only assume his inner turmoil became too much to bear and he lost all sense of reason," his family said. The first attack took place at 1pm on Sunday at the home of the Reverend Keith Blakely, where Carter opened fire. The minister's daughter, Angela, escaped but her father was killed and her grandparents were wounded. Angela, 19, had refused to go out with Carter, according to a local police officer. Within the next four hours, police said, Carter shot a former friend, Jonathon Lott, who had once helped officers to track down Carter. He then drove to the Miami-Dade county jail and shot two uniformed officers outside the building just before midnight. Sometime after that attack, Carter shot himself.
