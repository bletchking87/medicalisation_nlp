Age: As long as I can remember. Appearance: Are you blind? Can't you see the huge, black cloud on my shoulder? Are we a bit miserable? No, we are not 'a bit miserable' as you so tactlessly say. At one time or another 15 per cent of us are biologically ill with it. So ill that we feel worthless, hopeless, sleepless, sexless and . . . oh, God, what's the point? Remind me - why are we having this conversation? Because depression appears to be quite the thing just now. Scarcely a day goes by without some personage describing their own descent into gloom, and there are lots of books with titles like The Wisdom of Depression. Wasn't there a Big Book by a depressed scientist recently? You'll be thinking of Louis Wolpert. And Charlotte Rampling. Wasn't she being depressed in last week's Guardian? Yep. She's going to play Miss Haversham in Great Expectations. Says the old girl was a 'quintessential clinical depressive'. Wouldn't wash. Wouldn't go out. Derek Draper? Him too. 'Every-thing seemed hollow and pointless,' he wrote recently. So is depression the new rock'n'roll? 'It is the new black in fact,' according to the Scotsman. Still, talking helps, doesn't it? It certainly helps the post-industrial economy. Hampstead and Harley St would be depressed if the shamans, psychiatrists, and psychotherapists lost all their customers. It couldn't happen. It might. What if Nato attacked Hampstead with Prozac-tipped bombs, targeted on people with low seratonin. You made a joke! I knew talking would help. You're feeling better. No, I'm not. I'm very sad. Still it's only chemical, isn't it? No. A new US study suggests that placebos work as well as pills for one patient in three. Not to be confused with: A drastic fall in GNP. Heavy rain moving in from the Atlantic. A trip on Virgin Trains. Don't say: Cheer up. Do say: Everything seemed hollow and pointless to me once.
