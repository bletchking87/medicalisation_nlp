A necessity: A pair of glamorous shoes. If I get hit by depression, they cheer me up. Travelling is more stressful than people allow for. And I never go anywhere without my mascara. A luxury: A clock that doesn't work. It's in the shape of a genie's lamp and is covered in semi preecious stones. It's totally useless but really lovely. A memento: I always take a picture of Claudius sitting on a chair in my flat. If only: It would have to be some kind of portable bed with a really delicious mattress that moulds itself to your body.
