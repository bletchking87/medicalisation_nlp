Cranberries are commonly associated with cocktails and Christmas turkey - but a growing body of medical opinion claims they are good for your health. American researchers say cranberry juice can help to prevent bladder problems such as urinary tract infections. While trendy tipplers see the juice only as an essential ingredient in Seabreeze cocktails, the drink has been shown to stop E.coli bacteria from attaching to cells in the urinary tract and causing infection. Around half of women will have at least one infection in their lifetime, and many are plagued by persistent problems that often require antibiotic treatment. Researchers now believe compounds in cranberries may act by blocking or preventing growth of part of the bacteria that binds to the urinary tract and leads to infection.
