I absolutely agree with Guy Roukaerts (Letters, December 1) that "the multi-billion bidding war between banks is indecent". As the wife of an employee of NatWest, currently the object of a hostile takeover bid by the Royal Bank of Scotland, I find myself plunged into despair. Six years ago, my husband was made redundant by Bradford &amp; Bingley and we had months of uncertainty and depression. We survived by the skin of our teeth but we are still not back to the stage we were at before the redundancy. Now he is that much older he is going to be that much less employable. We face an uncertain future, all because of greedy little men who do nothing but play with other people's money. Thanks a bunch, RBS, and a merry bloody Christmas to you too. Name and address supplied
