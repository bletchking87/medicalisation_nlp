Funding for research into mental health is to be more than tripled by the Department of Health. The move, to be announced on Monday in a report called New Horizons, will take money committed to research on depression, schizophrenia and other aspects of mental health from about £50m a year to £150m. The dramatic increase in funding reflects a recent recognition by ministers and senior health officials that the impact of illnesses such as depression on Britain has been seriously underestimated. The cost of mental illness is now reckoned to be about £110bn a year. This includes spending by the NHS on treating patients as well as lost economic output. Far more effort is needed to understand the underlying roots of these illnesses, the report will argue. Apart from the misery experienced by those who are affected by depression or schizophrenia, it has also been found that these individuals suffer significantly increased risks of developing cancer or having heart attacks in later life. It has also been found that people with depression or schizophrenia are likely to have worse outcomes than others when they contract other serious illnesses, such as arthritis or diabetes. The solution, says the report, is to "broaden the range and level" of research funds spent on mental illness to deal with a problem where the impact is likely to increase.
