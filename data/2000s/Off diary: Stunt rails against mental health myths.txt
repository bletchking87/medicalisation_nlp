A leading campaign to end mental health discrimination will transform a commuter tram into a padded cell on Sunday. The stunt, organised by the Time to Change programme of projects, led by mental health charities Mental Health Media, Mind and Rethink, is part of a new Â£18m advertising campaign that shows how being told to "pull yourself together" or being treated as "a problem" can lead people with mental health problems to despair. The two-day event in Sheffield city centre will allow the public to ride in a padded-cell carriage emblazoned with slogans such as: "1 in 4 will have a mental health problem in their life; that's 50 on this tram - but they don't need to spend their days in a padded cell." Time to Change volunteers will be on hand to answer questions from the public about mental health issues. Sue Baker, Time to Change's director, says: "Mental illness is still taboo. People don't realise that one in four suffer from some form of mental illness in their life, and we're hoping that the campaign will dispel myths. The idea behind the stunt is to spark a debate." The four-week ad campaign, which starts on TV tonight, includes high-profile support from actor Stephen Fry and from Tony Blair's former press secretary, Alastair Campbell, who have both spoken openly about suffering from mental illness. The campaign is financed by the Big Lottery Fund and Comic Relief.
