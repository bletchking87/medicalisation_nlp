Josie Fletcher is 36, and lives in London. This is her experience: "I had a breakdown followed by severe depression. I had no previous history of illness, and I was thrown into the world of psychiatrists and mental hospitals. I was on a ward for 10 days initially. "It's not nice having a breakdown, but it wasn't made any easier by being there. The majority of staff didn't seem to be well trained in dealing with acute stress. "I just wanted someone to sit down and talk to me, to explain that I wasn't well but things would get better. "I was in my own room but on a mixed sex corridor. All the rooms were mixed sex, and there were people in varying stages of distress. Nothing happened, but I didn't feel safe. I was there for 10 days, but I wasn't offered any therapy. "I saw the psychiatrist once a week for 15 minutes. I was given drugs without being told what they were for. There was nothing therapeutic about it. Psychiatric wards are supposed to be somewhere where you feel safe, where you get better. But I didn't â€“ I was spiralling down. "I was a voluntary patient, and so my family took me out. I have recovered well since then, but I had savings and spent them on cognitive therapy at a private clinic. But everyone should be able to have that."
