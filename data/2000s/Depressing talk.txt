The war on drugs may be lost. But the war on medicines is hotting up. Some talk of boycotting BBC political editor Andrew Marr because he offered the prime minister an opportunity to comment on a mischievous rumour about antidepressants. Do they understand they are being rather unkind to everyone who has ever been prescribed medication for a mental condition? Should a legitimate treatment for a recognised malaise be a dark secret, and a sinister barometer of human worth or value? Should it be terrible even to "accuse" a person of such a moral failing? Apparently. That's an awful lot of people with an awful lot of shame.
