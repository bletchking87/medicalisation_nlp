Criminals held in secure mental health units are to be tracked with global positioning systems to stop them absconding and reoffending, under a trial by a London hospital trust. Patients will wear steel-reinforced leather ankle bracelets which will track their whereabouts to the nearest couple of metres when out on leave as part of their rehabilitation process and when they visit other hospitals for treatment. An alarm will be raised if they enter proscribed areas, such as the area around a schools or other zones from which they have been banned by the courts, or if they break their curfew. The trial, by South London and Maudseley NHS Trust, follows the conviction of Terrence O'Keefe, a 39-year-old rapist who escaped from the trust's care while attending an acute hospital for treatment. He went on the run and murdered 73-year-old David Kemp at his home in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in March last year. The trust apologised and said it would pilot the electronic tracking system this month for what is believed to be the first time in the mental health system. "Clearly what happened with O'Keefe should not have happened and we have tried to draw lessons from that," said a spokesman for the NHS trust. "We recognise there is a need to improve the security arrangements and there is clearly a weakness at these transfer points." Patients at the medium secure unit at Bethlem Royal hospital at Beckenham and Lambeth hospital in south London will be tagged when given leave to walk around the hospital grounds and when they are allowed out into the community.
