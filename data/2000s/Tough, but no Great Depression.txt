Businesses and consumers across the world must brace themselves for tough times, as the yearlong financial crisis tips almost all big economies into recession, the International Monetary Fund said yesterday. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's economic counsellor, welcomed the coordinated cuts in interest rates from six central banks, including the Bank of England, and taxpayer-backed bailouts of struggling banks. "It is clear that there will be tough economic times ahead," Blanchard said as he unveiled the IMF's half-yearly health check of the global economy in Washington. He said that financial markets were in the grip of "a downward spiral of loss of confidence and trust," and government rescue plans would take time to work. "The re-establishment of trust or, more formally, the decline in counterparty risk within the financial system, will take time. During that time, credit to the ultimate borrowers will be limited and expensive." The IMF's bleak warning came as Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said the credit crunch had also created a "human crisis" in many of the poorest countries, which required a coordinated response. He said the number of malnourished people was expected to increase by 44 million this year, to 967 million, as a result of high food prices. Despite its pessimistic assessment, the IMF said the risk of a new Great Depression was small. It expects 9% growth in China, 7% in India, and 6% in Africa to partly offset the weakness in the west. Overall, the IMF is forecasting 3% growth in the global economy, the slowest since the downturn that followed the dotcom crash. Blanchard said the severity of the crisis meant that governments would be forced to adopt coherent plans in the near future. "Under that assumption, I believe that the risk of a Great Depression is nearly nil."
