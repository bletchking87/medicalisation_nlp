Scotland's response to taking care of its own mental wellbeing is disarmingly positive; an action plan from the government in May entitled Towards A Mentally Flourishing Scotland. With that in mind, an arts festival designed to clear the stigma of mental health issues is an obvious choice. Alongside a huge range of arts and film events leaning towards the feelgood, Edinburgh's Filmhouse is hosting 50 Cents For Your Soul, a season that focuses on complex Hollywood female icons playing fragile but intriguing characters, such as Marilyn Monroe in her eerily titled final film The Misfits, the tragic but magnificent Judy Garland in I Could Go On Singing, and Greta Garbo's infamous calling card of depression in Grand Hotel: "I want to be alone". â€¢ Various venues, Thu to 22 Oct, visit mhfestival.com
