It's good to see Jenni Russell continuing her commentary on the damage caused to children by the high-stakes assessment regime (Comment, 16 April). She quotes the Cambridge University Primary Review: "It was difficult to avoid a sense of children in flight from an experience they found unsatisfactory, unmotivating and uncomfortable." I couldn't agree more, especially as I wrote this sentence. But it's not news. It was published in 2000, in What Pupils Say and reports findings of the Pace (Primary Assessment, Curriculum and Experience) research into the impact of the first six years of the national curriculum, and assessment on children and their teachers. The research was based in the University of Bristol and led by Professors Andrew Pollard and Patricia Broadfoot. Although the current groundswell of concern about Sats and league tables is very welcome, it is depressing that our findings, and those of many other excellent studies, have taken so long to become a part of public discourse. The children whose experiences we reported transferred to secondary school in 1997 and continued to "learn" under the same regime. They are now in their 20s. Andrew Pollard and I dedicated What Pupils Say to my newborn granddaughter, Isobel, "and all other children growing up in the new millennium - who challenge us to provide an enriching and worthwhile education". Next year Isobel will encounter Sats. We have wasted a lot of time and created a mass of damaging connotations around words like "learning" and "achievement". Change is long overdue.
