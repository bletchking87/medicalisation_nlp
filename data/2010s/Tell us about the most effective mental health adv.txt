As winter draws in and the days grow ever shorter, people with mental health issues can be hit particularly hard.

And there can be a profound comfort in sharing wisdom and experiences, or in reading something that speaks to you deeply. We’d like to find out about what works for you. Share your experiences What mental health advice had a profound impact on your life? What positive affirmations do you tell yourself daily? How do you raise your spirits when feeling down?
